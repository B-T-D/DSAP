Goal is absolute bare minimum code needed to implement the ADT from scratch.

No optimizations (like DSAP builds in). Some verbosity for readability, otherwise fewest possible
lines of code that do the job.

### Todo:
Binary tree one needs at least one traversal algorithm, probably multiple (for inorder, preordr, postorder, breadthfirst, maybe euler tour).
