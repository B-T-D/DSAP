# DSAP
Data structure and algorithm implementations in Python.

## Textbook code
To the extent code in this repository falls within copyright protection applicable to *Data Structures and Algorithms in Python* (Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2013)), my inclusion of that code is intended as non-commercial "fair use" under United States copyright law.

The textbook is [available at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275/). It's an excellent book. I strongly recommend buying a copy if you're coming from a Python background and want an authoritative, mathematical resource on data structures and algorithms!

## Original work
For all textbook code included in this repository, I manually typed it into the Python source files here (rather than pasting from resources associated with the textbook). All unit tests covering the textbook's code are my original work.
