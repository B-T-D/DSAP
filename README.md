# DSAP
Data structure and algorithm implementations in Python.

## Textbook code
To the extent code in this repository falls within copyright protection applicable to *Data Structures and Algorithms in Python* (Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2013)), my inclusion of that code is intended as non-commercial "fair use" under United States copyright law.

The textbook is [available at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275/). It's an excellent book. I strongly recommend buying a copy if you're coming from a Python background and want an authoritative, mathematical resource on data structures and algorithms!

## Original work
For all textbook code included in this repository, I manually typed it into the Python source files here (rather than pasting from resources associated with the textbook). All unit tests in this repository are my original work.

## Use of this repo
This is meant as static reference code, not as a Python package. I made the repo public on the off chance someone might happen upon it and find it helpful. I wouldn't recommend cloning it as-is and trying to use it in a project. For example the requirements.txt may erroneously include some clutter stuff that's not actually needed for this repo's code, so you wouldn't want to have pip install those dependencies en masse. Also there would be license issues because of the code from the textbook.
